Challenge-Week-1 (*ARJAN*)
For our first week we're gonna be doing some basic data file manipulation! 
I've provided a data file with three columns of values, which we're gonna pretend are sugar concentrations in apples,
oranges and a control. Unfortunately your equipment is a bit dodgy and you're gonna have to do some data cleaning before
we can begin! 
Task 1: clean data. 
Your csv file contains a few NaN values, values at -999 (can't have negative sugar concentration!) and a few extra commas.
Clean it up! What's the best way to deal with these values?

Task 2: Basic stats 
Calculate the mean and SD of your data

Task 3: graph it up! 
Draw a histogram (or series of histograms) of your data. What's the best way to visualise this in your language?

Challenge-Week-2 (*ALEX*)
You have 200(ish) cows of varying ages, with data on sex, date of birth, and 2 
traits. You want to find out whether there has been phenotypic progress in your trait(s) 
of interest over time. Your data has dates of birth in it, but you only need Year of
Birth. Extract this information from your data. Can you plot your trait in a way that 
separates the cows by year of birth? How do you quantify the level of progress (if any) 
in your trait over time?

Why? This is again probably a lot simpler than some of the others, but again like Suzanne 
I think a lot of beginners will want more practice with data manipulation. This is a pretty 
boring work related task but is the sort of thing that you might want to look at at the 
beginning of a genetic analysis? Its also something that could maybe be extended at a later date.

Challenge-Week-3 (*TOMASZ*)
One of the main challenges of using genotypes for genomic evaluations is to ensure data quality and validating that genotypes
belong to the right animals. When an animal and its offspring are genotyped we can do parentage verification. When we get
negative result we need to run parentage discovery. This is very computationally demanding for large datasets. There are 108
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified for cattle which give high accuracy for checking parent-offspring
relationship. 

The method that we use to assign parentage is via exclusion. The genotypes of parent and offspring are compared, and if they
do not match (i.e an animal with genotype AA cannot be the parent of an animal with genotype BB at the same marker) The 108
SNP panel has been chosen because these SNPs are highly variable within the population, and so you wouldn't expect the
genotypes to match just by chance. The genotypes provided are coded as 0 (homozygous reference e,g AA) 1 (heterozygous e.g AB)
and 2(alternate homozygous e.g BB). 

Use the list of SNPs (file: parentageSNPs.txt) and find possible sires for all animals. Simulated data can be found in file
mMatrixFileSimulated_54609_1000_1.dat. All animals have been genotyped using Illumina 50k V2 chip (file: Illumina50kV2map.txt). 

Deliverables: 1. Provide a flowchart of your solution. Please do not start coding until we finalise it during our next meeting.
You can use http://www.gliffy.com/ (week 1) 2. Write software which takes input files in fixed format and outputs a list of
possible sires for every animal. (week 2)

Requirements: 1. It should be possible to change the names of your input files without altering the code. 2. Use functions
and/or procedures. 3. Use UML naming convention.
